                <h4>WELCOME TO AMD</h4>
                

                <P>Huge demand is expected from the market for professionally trained designers in the near future, both in India and abroad, and under the present circumstances, only a small fraction of it is realised yet. In an environment where designers are engaged in different job functions within the design departments, a design job has several occupations, applications and expectation. In such a scenario, the need for professionally trained individuals arises. Design and media studies, with its hybrid nature, prepare designers with specialisation in a particular domain while having varying degrees of knowledge and skills to address specific occupations and opens up several career pathways. </P>

                <P>At Academy of Media and Design, we create an environment that helps students realise their creativity and explore the creative potential within themselves. We focus on a single subject- learning and not teaching. We equip aspiring digital artists with the skill set and the certifications for a promising career, by creating and giving a focused learning experience. Courses at AMD have been curated in a manner that focuses more on the learning outcome, that helps create 'Ready to Work' professionals and not just graduates. Our curriculum has been designed in a way that focuses on giving the students a learning experience, that bridges the gap between academy and industry. We help students to create a focus, that allows them to master the skills, that enhances their innovative and creative capacity.</P>
